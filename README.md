### Biography

I specialize in Infrastructure, Cloud, and Security, with proficiency in a range of key platforms and tools. My expertise spans AWS and Azure cloud environments, along with proficiency in managing Redhat Enterprise Linux and Windows Server infrastructures. I have a solid grasp of security solutions, including Crowdstrike, Proofpoint TAP/TRAP, Extrahop, and Zerofox, bolstered by a deep understanding of vulnerability management utilizing Tenable.sc and Tenable.io. Additionally, I'm skilled in log management and analysis using Devo, ensuring robust security and operational efficiency. I've even dabbled in Ansible automation during my tenure as a infrastructure engineer where I automated the Linux server patching process. 

In my current role the documentation of repeatable cyber security procedures is critical during an incident response. 
Along with digital forensics, dark web monitoring and vulnerability management, I enjoy collaborating with others to translate processes into user friendly documents. 

One of my most recent certificate journeys led me to obtaining my AWS Associate Architect where I not only adding a Cloud skill but I also learned the value of engaging learning content to help pass the exam. 

Outside of my job and I have an obsessive interest in photography and am also passionate about audio and video production engineering. 

As a Tech veteran I can appreacite how fast technology evolves and I keep it fresh by taking action to learn new things.
